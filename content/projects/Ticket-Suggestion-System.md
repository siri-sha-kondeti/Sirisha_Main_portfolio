## Description
The Ticket Suggestion System is an AI-driven solution designed to assist IT support agents in resolving new tickets efficiently by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic search techniques. Built using Python, FAISS, and Streamlit, the system analyzes incoming support tickets and matches them with previously resolved cases based on cosine similarity and semantic embeddings.

The NLP-powered backend ensures precise analysis of ticket descriptions, while the FAISS index enables fast and scalable similarity searches across large datasets of historical tickets. The Streamlit-based frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing support agents to input ticket details and instantly receive relevant suggestions for solutions.

By reducing repetitive manual searches and offering AI-driven recommendations, this system significantly enhances response time, accuracy, and workflow efficiency for IT support teams.

- This project highlights the seamless integration of AI, NLP, and scalable search algorithms to optimize IT support workflows and deliver actionable insights in real-time.
