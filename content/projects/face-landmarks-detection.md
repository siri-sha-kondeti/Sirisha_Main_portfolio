## Description

This project focuses on developing an advanced Face Detection and 3D Reconstruction system using landmark points to achieve precise facial recognition and lifelike 3D facial representations. Leveraging Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques, the system accurately detects faces in images and video streams, maps key facial features, and reconstructs them in three dimensions.

The face detection module ensures reliable identification of faces even in complex or dynamic environments. The landmark detection module precisely maps facial features, enabling detailed analysis of facial geometry. The 3D reconstruction module utilizes these landmark points to create accurate 3D representations of detected faces.

This system can be applied in various domains, including biometric authentication, virtual avatar creation, medical imaging, security systems, and entertainment technologies. The integration of accurate face detection with precise 3D reconstruction makes this project a valuable contribution to the evolving landscape of facial recognition and analysis.
