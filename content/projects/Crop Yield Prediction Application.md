## Description

Developed an advanced crop yield prediction application for a regional
agricultural cooperative, enhancing farming decisions and yield forecasts with remarkable precision. Utilized a
robust tech stack including Crop Disease detection, CNN, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, FAST
API, sci-kit-learn, PyTorch, Numpy, and Pandas for effective data analysis and predictive modeling.
Integrated cutting-edge data preprocessing techniques such as statistical analysis, feature engineering, and data
normalization to refine model accuracy. Historical weather data were incorporated using OpenWeatherMap API
and also used Leaflet maps for visualization and real-time projection.

## Crop Disease detection
- Looking ahead, I'm excited about the next phase of this project, which involves integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) to diagnose plant diseases. This feature will enable early detection and more effective management of crop health, potentially saving crops from significant damage.

- Additionally, I'm working on incorporating Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the impact of climate and soil moisture levels on crop yields. These tools provide real-time insights and actionable advice to optimize farming conditions and improve crop productivity.
