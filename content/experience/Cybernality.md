### Description
As a **Senior Software Developer specializing in Generative AI and Machine Learning** at **Cybernality GmbH**, I have been deeply involved in developing a **cybersecurity co-pilot** designed to analyze security alerts, reduce false positives, and prioritize alarms, enabling efficient handling by less-experienced security personnel. My role involved extensive **data preprocessing**, where I reduced sentence lengths, cleaned, and rephrased TTPs to enhance model comprehension without losing their core meaning.  

I leveraged **SecureBERT** for identifying and handling domain-specific terms, improving the detection and interpretation of technical concepts in cybersecurity data. Using **GPT-3.5**, I rephrased complex text to ensure clarity, readability, and diversity while preserving the original intent. Additionally, I integrated **preprocessed TTP data into Neo4j**, allowing dynamic visualization of **TTPs and SubTTPs** and their relationships, making threat analysis more intuitive.  

To enhance user guidance, I incorporated **MISTRAL** with the **Neo4j GraphDatabase**, empowering the co-pilot to guide users in identifying and navigating cybersecurity techniques and tactics effectively. Furthermore, I applied the **TTPXHunter methodology** to extract actionable intelligence from finished cyber threat reports, contributing to smarter and more informed decision-making processes.  

In this role, I combined technical expertise with innovative AI methodologies, contributing to a robust, AI-powered cybersecurity solution aimed at simplifying complex threat analysis and improving overall security response efficiency.
