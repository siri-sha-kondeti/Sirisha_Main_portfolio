## Description

As a Software Developer at Talent Capital, I led the development and maintenance of a scalable e-commerce platform backend using Django, REST API, and MySQL. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless transactions, efficient order management, and secure data handling, utilizing SSL encryption to protect data in transit while managing and analyzing large datasets effectively.

I worked closely with UI/UX designers to create intuitive wireframes and mockups for the dashboard interface and implemented them using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I enhanced the dashboard with interactive features such as drill-downs, filtering, sorting, and dynamic data updates, providing users with a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Additionally, I designed and deployed a desktop application using Tkinter and Custom Tkinter for project management, enabling teams to collaborate effectively and track project progress in real-time.

I also designed and implemented web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and deployed them on Apache servers, following strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with extensive use of Python and JavaScript.

In backend development, I built and optimized RESTful Web Service APIs using Python and MySQL, ensuring efficient web-based data retrieval and system performance.

Throughout my role, I emphasized building interactive, data-driven UI components, fostering team collaboration, and adhering to Agile methodologies, contributing to project efficiency and delivery in a dynamic and fast-paced development environment.
