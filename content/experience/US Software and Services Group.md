### Description

As a **Senior Software Developer** at **US Software and Services Group**, I played a key role in designing and deploying **AI and NLP-driven solutions**, focusing on enhancing operational efficiency and delivering intelligent systems across diverse domains. I worked extensively with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** methods, leveraging **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)** and **T5 models** to develop advanced chatbot systems capable of generating meaningful and context-aware responses.  

My expertise included fine-tuning **Large Language Models (LLMs)** such as **GPT, BERT**, and **Hugging Face Transformers** for specialized tasks like **text classification, summarization**, and **question-answering**, while applying **prompt engineering techniques** to optimize output accuracy and relevance. I implemented **similarity search** using **cosine similarity** and **vector embeddings** to improve document retrieval systems, using pre-trained models to handle **named entity recognition (NER)** and **sentiment analysis** tasks effectively.  

I have hands-on experience working with **structured and unstructured datasets**, including **text, image, graph, time series, and synthetic data**, ensuring robust **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **post-processing techniques** like **probability calibration** and **threshold adjustment**. My contributions extended to **ML model deployment** using scalable frameworks such as **TensorFlow** and **Hugging Face**, focusing on **real-time inference** and **model optimization**.  

In cloud technologies, I worked with **AWS (SageMaker, Lambda, S3, EC2)** and **Azure (Azure ML Studio, Data Lake)** to deploy and manage AI applications efficiently. Additionally, I integrated **Python-React JS applications** using **Docker** and automated workflows with **CI/CD pipelines**.  

I also contributed to **medical image analysis projects**, leveraging **DICOM data formats**, **OpenCV**, **PyTorch**, and **AWS SageMaker** for **image segmentation, feature extraction**, and **classification tasks**, ensuring compliance with medical imaging standards.  

Beyond technical implementation, I focused on **cost optimization**, achieving an **8% reduction in operational expenses** through strategic resource allocation. I worked in **Agile environments**, utilizing tools like **JIRA** for project management and **MS Tools** for documentation and data processing.  

Throughout my tenure, I combined **technical expertise** with **strategic problem-solving**, delivering scalable, efficient, and impactful AI and ML solutions across a wide range of business use cases.
